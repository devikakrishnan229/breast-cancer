# breast-cancer
This repository contains 2 machine learning models for breast cancer detection using the datset breast cancer wisconsin(diagnostic). Our aim is to check whether the tumour is benign or malignant. 

the modles that we used are logistic regression and neural networks. logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 97 % and neural network model achieved 97% as well.

So what we have done is we have cloned the repository and created a branch named new_modle for the 2nd ipynb file.
